# HEAPSORT
# How it Works: it build the Max Heap and then expoloit that ordinated data structure.
#
# HEAP: A binary tree where root is bigger than all child of all sublevel. Can be rappresented by an array were root is in first cell, then first level children, then second...
# The foundamental property is that if i is the subtree root, left element is at 2*i+1 index and right at 2*i+2
#        10(0)
#       /  \
#     5(1)  3(2)     =>  [10 5 3 4 1]
#     /   \
# 4(3)    1(4)
#
# To make a heap from an array starting from the level before leafs ones current root should be compared with the leaf and swapped if minor than one
# than the modified subtree should be heapified again with recursion, that will put the old root down to its place. The last level checked is the first
# root node, so the build start from last array element to the first.
# Note that the heapify algorithm required the two subtree to be heaps since it only checked the modified subtree and not the others,
# so it's necessary to first heapify the lowest levels then go to the highest
#
# Once build the heap, the heap sort algorithm simply take the first element of the array (the max of array) and  put it to the end, than it rebuild the max heap
#Â Reducing the array of one element (the last wich is ordered)

    # Note that the tree is not binary search so left or right value makes no difference, they must only be minor than the root
