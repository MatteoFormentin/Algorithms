# Levenshtein Distance Algorithm
# Calculate how much two string differ each other in terms of insert a new letter, delete one or substitute it (no swap)
# Works by building a matrix with one string as row and one as column, on the row 0 and column 0 is placed an empty character that means empty string.
# Each submatrix [0,m][0,n] is the substring distance, building the full matrix on [len(a)][len(b)] there is the Levenshtein distance.
# Building equation:
# # lev[i,j] = min{lev[i-1,j-1] + c , lev[i,j-1] + 1 , lev[i-1,j] + 1 }
# lev[i - 1, j] + 1,     // insert - go left
# lev[i, j - 1] + 1,      // delete - go up
# lev[i - 1, j - 1] + c   // substitute
# On each step Ã¬t is searched the minum operation to align the substring
